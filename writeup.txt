Task 7:

    I had trouble with filling the mip levels -- when it zooms in, the whole canvas becomes white, and when it zooms out, there is aliasing.
    It's not nicely blended, either, like the reference solution is. 
    I understand that we must find the MipMap level based log_2-ing the ratio between the current sample buffer resolution and the texture resolution,
    to get to the level below and the level above. Then, we perform bilinear sampling on the level below and the level above on the given coordinate,
    and sample between them with a weight using the (non-int) level we got using log to find the distance to each level. 
    I also understand that the MipMap levels are populated using the average of the 4 texels overlapping it in the previous level, but I think that is where I am running into problems.
    I'm not one hundred percent certain that I'm doing the right thing when 

Task 8:

Any other comments and considerations:

    I was confused about where the du/dx and dv/dy etc. came from when it came to trilinear filtering. 
    I also had to dig through Piazza to realize that we have to call the sampling functions from sampler, so if that had been in the write-up, that would have been very helpful.
